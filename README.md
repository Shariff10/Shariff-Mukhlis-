## About Me

Hi there! I'm Shariff Mukhlis Rahmatullah bin Mahat Saring, a 22-year-old Interactive Media Computer Science student from University Technical of Malaysia Malacca. I am passionate about full-stack development, and I love exploring new technologies.

## Skills

Here are the technical skills I have:

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript
-   React
-   jQuery
-   Java OOP
-   Rust

I use neovim as my text editor, and I have intermediate-level skills in all the above technologies.

## Experience

Apart from being a developer, I also have experience in graphic design, videographic media, art, and 3D design. I believe that creativity is just as important as technical skills, and that's why I always try to incorporate my artistic talents into my projects.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

-   Vaccine Management System
-   Bus Management System
-   Attendance System

All of these projects are available on my GitHub profile. Please feel free to check them out and let me know what you think!
